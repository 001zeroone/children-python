It is distributed as a zip file. If you downloaded the pyamta_aio distribution from Github and extracted the files, you will find a libraries.zip file in the FirmataPlus directory. You can also directly download it [here](https://github.com/MrYsLab/pymata-aio/blob/master/FirmataPlus/libraries.zip). Click on the "view raw" button to download.

Open the Arduino IDE and select File/Preferences to determine your _sketchbook_ location. 

Close the Arduino IDE and extract the libraries.zip file into the sketchbook location directory.

Re-open the Arduino IDE, select File/Examples/FirmataPlusRB/FiramataPlusRB and upload to your RedBot Controller Board.
