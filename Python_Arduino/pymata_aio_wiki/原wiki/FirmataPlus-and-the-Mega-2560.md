The Mega 2560 has [a bug](http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=77961.0) in its boot loader when using the AVR watchdog timer. If you are using the Mega 2560, please use [this version](https://github.com/MrYsLab/PyMata/blob/master/ArduinoSketch/libraries.zip) of FirmataPlus to avoid the bug or StandardFirmata if you do not require the extended features of FirmataPlus. Please note that older version of FirmataPlus does not support the keepalive feature.
